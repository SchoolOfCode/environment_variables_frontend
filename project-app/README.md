# Project Clean-up

This is the final project app we created while attending the School Of Code (25 April - 16 August 2022).

Project Clean-Up is an app that allows people to create litter cleanup events or join other peoples.

Once you fill out the "start a clean" form, your event marker will be populated on the map and other users will be able to join in.

We chose this app idea as we are all aware of the pollution crisis the world is facing and we wanted to be pro-active about addressing this.

## Challenges we faced

- Using Next Js, Tailwind and Formik for the first time

## Overcoming our challenges

Although it was a learning curve to introduce new technologies to our final project, it was something that was important to us as a team as we wanted to push ourselves a little and learn some of the technology that is hot in the industry at the moment.

Furthermore, School of Code has equippped us with the skills to confidently read documentation and safely navigate our way through error messages and bug issues.

## What we took from this experience

Apart from learning new technology and re-enforcing our existing coding knowledge, the main thing we focused on and learnt during this final project was how success can be obtained through team-work.

Success to us not only meant having a good app, but more importantly, getting through the month wihtout any confrontation, making sure everyone was on the same page at all times (as to not be left behind) and just having an all-round enjoyable experience together...which is what we feel we have achieved.

Furthermore, working in an Agile environment and taking on an iterative approach to our project through user feedback and revision was an invaluable experience for us and will surely put us all in good stead for when we take on our first positions as developers.

Given more time, there are alot more features and functionality we would implement, but we worked hard at all times and we are very pleased with the end-result.
