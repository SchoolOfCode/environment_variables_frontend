          Get some friends together, make a family day of it, take your pupils
          out for an educational excursion, or even take your corporate team for
          an authentic team building experience. Whatever you choose, you will make a positive impact on the
          environment. There are many benefits from getting involved with a
          clean-up; not only are you making a massive difference to the planet,
          you are immersing yourself in the great outdoors, keeping active,
          and meeting new peopleâ€”all at the same time.
